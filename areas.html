                            In my independent research at Kyoto University Hospital, I uncovered a novel tumor
                            suppressive mechanism in B-lymphomas: internal CXCL13 expression leads to CXCR5 receptor
                            internalization, disrupting essential germinal center migration and triggering lymphoma
                            apoptosis. This intrinsic pathway, driven by a distal super-enhancer on the CCNG2 locus,
                            reveals a previously unknown mechanism of natural B-lymphoma suppression.
                            Further, I demonstrated that aberrant CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling in solid tumors (e.g., HCT116,
                            HepG2) enhances expression of cell cycle regulators (PTP4A1), metastatic receptors (CCR7),
                            and ubiquitin ligases involved in the p53 degradation, contributing to drug resistance via
                            p53 dysregulation.
                            This approach led to the identification of CCR7, PTP4A1, and p53-specific ubiquitin ligases
                            as novel therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of CXCL13 and co-expressed CXCR5
                            signaling.

                                During my doctoral studies at Osaka University, I developed a strong foundation in
                                chromosome biology,
                                with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms governing DNA double-strand break
                                (DSB) formation
                                and repair during meiosis. Using budding yeast meiosis as a model system, I investigated
                                how chromatin
                                structure and transcriptional activity influence meiotic recombination.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My research addressed the interplay between epigenetic regulators, cohesin complexes,
                                and the
                                transcriptional machinery that together shape meiotic chromosome architecture into
                                loop–axis domains.
                                I identified the RNA polymerase II elongation complex <strong>Paf1C</strong> as a
                                central regulator of
                                histone modifications, including H2BK123 ubiquitination and H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79
                                trimethylation,
                                which are critical for higher-order chromatin organization.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Importantly, I demonstrated that Paf1C regulates the spatial distribution of programmed
                                DSBs by
                                promoting Spo11-dependent DSB formation at recombination hotspots while suppressing
                                breaks at cold
                                spots (Gothwal <em>et al.</em>, <em>Genetics</em>, 2016). This mechanism safeguards
                                genome inheritance
                                by preventing chromosomal mis-segregation, aneuploidy, and genome instability.

                                These findings have broad relevance to chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome and
                                Klinefelter
                                syndrome, which arise from defective meiotic chromosome segregation. In cancer biology,
                                mammalian
                                homologues of Paf1C and SET1 methyltransferases are frequently overexpressed, with MLL1
                                fusions being
                                common in childhood leukemia and several solid tumors.

                            <p>
                                Building on this foundation, my current research examines the role of
                                <strong>WDR5</strong>, a core
                                component of the MLL1 complex, which is highly expressed in glioblastoma and other solid
                                cancers.
                                Aberrant transcription driven by these chromatin regulators promotes oncogenic signaling
                                and alters
                                proteasomal regulation of high-fidelity DNA repair pathways, particularly homologous
                                recombination.

                            <p>
                                During my postdoctoral training under Prof. Tasuku Honjo, I expanded my research into
                                site-specific recombination in B cells, focusing on the molecular mechanisms by which
                                Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at
                                immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during antibody class-switch recombination (CSR). While CSR is
                                essential for antibody diversification, it also poses inherent risks of chromosomal
                                translocations and genome instability.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My work centered on elucidating how the histone acetyl-reader protein
                                <strong>BRD2</strong> regulates the repair of AID-induced DSBs. I demonstrated that BRD2
                                promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) while suppressing homologous recombination
                                (HR)
                                and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), thereby biasing repair toward the
                                canonical
                                pathway used during CSR (Gothwal <em>et al.</em>, <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>,
                                2024).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Mechanistically, BRD2 coordinates DSB repair by recruiting cohesin loaders such as
                                <strong>NIPBL</strong>, the architectural protein <strong>CTCF</strong>, and other
                                chromatin
                                regulators to the Ig locus, ensuring efficient and spatially constrained NHEJ. However,
                                this same architectural framework also facilitates pathogenic IgH–MYC chromosomal
                                translocations, thereby contributing to B-lymphomagenesis.

                            <p>
                                These findings revealed a dual role for BRD2: safeguarding genome integrity during
                                physiological antibody diversification while simultaneously enabling oncogenic
                                rearrangements under dysregulated conditions. Notably, mutations in NIPBL—classically
                                associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS)—may also impair humoral immune
                                responses,
                                highlighting broader links between chromatin architecture, immunity, and disease.

                                Beyond its role in CSR, BRD2 emerged as a potential oncogenic driver in B cells.
                                Nevertheless, germinal center (GC) reactions deploy intrinsic tumor-suppressive
                                checkpoints
                                that eliminate B cells bearing non-functional or oncogenic receptors. Building on this
                                observation, subsequent projects explored how these checkpoints restrict affinity
                                maturation and prevent GC exit of potentially malignant clones.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Importantly, bromodomain proteins such as BRD2 are also actionable therapeutic targets.
                                Small-molecule inhibitors, including <strong>JQ1</strong>, have demonstrated efficacy in
                                suppressing BRD-dependent oncogene expression. Collectively, this body of work
                                establishes
                                BRD2 as a critical regulator of genome stability and a promising target in B-cell
                                malignancies.

                                The germinal center (GC) reaction is a central process in the humoral immune response,
                                enabling B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and antibody class-switch
                                recombination,
                                ultimately generating high-affinity antibodies. Upon antigenic stimulation, GC B cells
                                upregulate two key regulators: <strong>BCL6</strong>, which promotes B-cell survival and
                                proliferation, and <strong>activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)</strong>, which
                                introduces programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to drive antibody diversification.

                            <p>
                                While AID activity is indispensable for immune adaptation, it also poses a substantial
                                oncogenic risk. Off-target DNA breaks can give rise to chromosomal translocations such
                                as
                                <strong>IgH–MYC</strong> and <strong>IgH–BCL6</strong>, which are hallmark lesions of
                                Burkitt’s lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In addition, malignancies
                                such
                                as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and multiple myeloma arise from mutated B
                                cells that have passed through memory or plasma cell differentiation stages.

                                Despite lifelong and repeated activation of GC reactions in humans, these lymphomas
                                remain
                                relatively infrequent. This paradox strongly suggests that germinal centers harbor
                                robust
                                intrinsic quality-control mechanisms capable of identifying and eliminating potentially
                                malignant B cells before malignant transformation occurs. Consequently, GC-derived
                                B-lymphomas represent a powerful biological system for uncovering endogenous tumor
                                suppression mechanisms.

                                Importantly, because many of the identified genes encode pharmacologically tractable
                                proteins, this GC-based screening strategy highlights a rational framework for
                                discovering
                                novel chemotherapeutic targets directly from physiological tumor-suppression programs.

                            Identification of MBD1 as a novel therapeutic target (Kanazawa University as an independent
                            researcher)- I developed a unique approach using Raji cells to screen novel tumor
                            suppression mechanisms. Raji is a germinal center (GC) derived-B-lymphoma. The GC-derived
                            B-lymphomas are naturally suppressed in GCs, thus they could be informative on tumor
                            suppressor mechanism if induced with genotoxic-stress, similar to B cells experience in GC
                            microenvironment. I treated Raji with Hydroxyurea (HU), simulating a genotoxic stress as
                            faced by GC B cells i.e. DNA-replication stress. Among several induced genes in HU-induced
                            genotoxic stress in Raji cells MBD1, a gene encoding for DNA-CpG methylation-binding protein
                            was induced. Functional analysis revealed that MBD1 suppresses genomic instabilities at the
                            BCL6 locus, preventing BCL6 rearrangements. BCL6-translocations are observed in 31% of
                            diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other cancers (Gothwal et al., 2024, In
                            Preparation). MBD1 also inhibits IRF4 and PRDM1, key regulators of plasma B cell
                            differentiation, suggesting its role in suppressing multiple myeloma (a plasma B cell
                            malignancy). Furthermore, MBD1 depletion sensitized Raji cells to HU, gemcitabine, and
                            etoposide, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancers resistant to DNA
                            replication inhibitors.
